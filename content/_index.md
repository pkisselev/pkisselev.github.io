# Therapy

I am a licensed clinical psychologist and I help people who worry a lot and get anxious. I treat a variety of anxiety and mood disorders, including

*   generalized anxiety
*   panic disorder
*   social phobia
*   performance anxiety
*   agoraphobia
*   major depression

My approach to therapy is psychodynamic. In general, this means exploring aspects of self which may be hidden by paying close attention to your emotions, interpersonal relationships, and family history.

I treat people ages 16 through 65.

I work with most insurance companies. Please call for specific information.
