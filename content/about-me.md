+++

I have moved to Seattle from Russia in 1993 and I am especially familiar with issues of immigration and cultural identity. I graduated from [Seattle Pacific University](http://www.spu.edu/depts/spfc/clinicalpsych/index.asp) and completed my internship training at the University of [Washington Counseling Center](https://depts.washington.edu/counsels/).

It takes commitment to make progress in therapy, so if you are ready I will make my best effort to understand you, help you figure out whatâ€™s wrong, and guide you towards your goal.
