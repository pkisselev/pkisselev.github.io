Many people are shy. In contemporary American culture, shyness has become somewhat of a detriment, as we are encouraged to speak up, network, and put ourselves out there. Shyness and social anxiety are on a continuum of human experiences and it may be difficult to draw the line. A shy person may feel nervous before going to a dinner party but she will give herself a little nudge, do it anyway, and be able to enjoy herself and others.

However, a person with a social anxiety disorder will worry a lot before going to a party, will experience a sense of terrible fear and physical symptoms like lightheadedness, sweating, nausea, stomachache, will draw a blank when talking to another person, and will try to avoid going to similar events. Usually people with this disorder are afraid of being humiliated, worry about others’ perceptions of themselves, and are very sensitive to criticism. They may wonder: “What if I say something stupid? I hope no one notices that I’m tense. I hope I’m not over/under-dressed,” etc. Those who experience this degree of discomfort in social settings may end up dropping out of school, passing up on job promotions, or severely limiting their social interactions.

Therapy and sometimes medication can be incredibly helpful if you feel this way. If you are not ready to come in for therapy, here are several ideas which may help you cope with your anxiety on your own: 1) Prepare to relax – do a deep-breathing exercise for 15 minutes before leaving your house; 2) Seek out social situations – to relearn and to practice simply being around other people; 3) Focus your attention outward not inward – for example pay attention to the way the place is decorated; 4) Prepare and ask people questions which require more than a yes or no answer; 5) Remind yourself that socially confident people also make lame jokes and embarrass themselves at times, it is how fast you can recover and enjoy that part of you that’s important.
